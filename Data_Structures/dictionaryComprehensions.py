# Set = {1, 2, 3}
# Dictionary = {1: "a", 2: "b"}

# Whenever we have a pattern like this, we can just use a dictionary comprehension (l#ine 15)
#values = []
#for x in range(5):
    #values.append(x * 2)

# This line of code is the same as the top
#values = [x * 2 for x in range(5)]

# Now this is a set
#values = {x * 2 for x in range(5)} 

# Now this is a dictionary 
#values = {x: x * 2 for x in range(5)}
#print(values)

# Tuples? -> Generator 
#values = (x * 2 for x in range(5))
